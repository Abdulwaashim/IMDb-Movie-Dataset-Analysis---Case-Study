# IMDb Movie Dataset Analysis

## Introduction

The "IMDb Movie Dataset Analysis" case study involves exploring a dataset sourced from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb). This dataset contains various attributes of movies, providing insights into the movie industry, including financial performance, genres, languages, and production trends. The objective is to create an informative and interactive Power BI dashboard to extract meaningful insights and trends from the movie industry.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following columns:

1. **budget\_x**: Estimated or actual cost of producing the film.
2. **country**: Country of origin or production for the movie.
3. **date\_x**: Associated date (e.g., release date, production date).
4. **genre**: Genres categorizing the movie based on themes and content.
5. **names**: Individuals involved in the production or acting (e.g., directors, actors, writers).
6. **orig\_lang**: Original language of the movie.
7. **orig\_title**: Original title used in the movie's country of origin.
8. **Profit/Loss**: Financial performance calculated as the difference between revenue and budget.
9. **revenue**: Total revenue generated by the movie.
10. **score**: A score or rating associated with the movie (scale: 0â€“100).
11. **status**: Current status of the movie (e.g., In Production, Released).

## Problem Statement

The goal of this analysis is to visualize and explore the IMDb dataset to derive actionable insights into the movie industry. Using Power BI, an interactive dashboard is created to provide users with a holistic view of movie trends, financial performance, and preferences.

## Dashboard Insights

The Power BI dashboard highlights the following:

1. **Total Number of Movies**: 9,656 movies in the dataset.
2. **Total Number of Genres**: 2,305 unique genres.
3. **Total Profit/Loss**: 1.9 trillion (combined value).

### Key Visualizations:

- **Movies by Country**: Bar chart showing the count of movies produced by each country in descending order.
- **Movies by Genre**: Tree map displaying the count of movies for each genre.
- **Movies by Language**: Pie chart showing the distribution of movies by their original language.
- **Rating vs. Revenue**: A scatter plot showing the relationship between movie ratings and revenue.
- **Slicers**: Filters for country and status to dynamically adjust all visualizations.
